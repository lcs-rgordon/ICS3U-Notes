// A "variable" is a place to store a single piece of information
// We can find the "data type" for a variable by Option-clicking the variable name
// This is an example of a String data type
var greeting = "Hello, playground"


// Create a variable named "age", which has a data type of Int
// Stores values like -7, 0, 15, etc
var age = 44

// Create a variable named "balance", which has a data type of Double
// Stores values that are numeric with decimal portions, like 1229.34
var balance = 1229.0

// Constants are just like variables except that once set, the value cannot change
let approximatelyPi = 3.14
//approximatelyPi = 4
